# minikanren-playground

Extremely early prototype of an interactive programming assistant/programming playground, based on the relational interpreter approach in miniKanren.

To run the playground, load the file `playground.rkt` in DrRacket, press the `Run` button in DrRacket to evaluate the Racket code, and then enter `(play)` in the bottom pane of DrRacket, at the carrot `>`.

The directory `PaperScreenshots` contains a few possible interface ideas.

Thanks to Michael Ballantyne and Alex Warth for discussions and early feedback on the idea, and to Evan Czaplicki, Stephanie Weirich, Nehal Patel, and Matt Hammer for inspiration.
