<nothing here yet...in work>

Extremely early prototype of an interactive programming assistant, based on the relational interpreter approach in miniKanren.

Thanks to Michael Ballantyne and Alex Warth for discussions and early feedback on the idea, and to Evan Czaplicki, Stephanie Weirich, Nehal Patel, and Matt Hammer for inspiration in exploring what Relational Reactive Programming might mean.
